## Drawbacks & Suggestions

### Drawbacks
1.Fliter options -city, state, country, and shape are case sensitive 
For eg: country 'us' is entered as 'US' results are not displayed

### Suggestions
1.For Fliter options -city, state, country, and shape , results should be irrespective of case sensitivity.
2.For date filter  between (like from date TO to date) option can be added to get more versatile data.
